## Description

Adds several rectangular platforms. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle but collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable.

//I added colour, blob eats snacks, changed canvas size and colour depending on mood, and change of heights

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Convert a circular sprite to an AABB for collision
- Implement overlap test and push-out resolution
- Manage grounded state only when landing on top faces

---

## Setup and Interaction Instructions use arrows or WAD to move the blob side to side and up. 
## Assets
W - up
A - left 
D - right
User can also use the arrows
N/A

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane but she used GenAI to write the comments.

This updated code was written with the help of GenAI to change the blob colour during jumps and create the "eating" feature.
